-- SQL to Extract Stored procedure DDL from Redshift for current database
-- Updated 5/25/2022 by Bob Maglies @ Snowflake
--    Added support for stored procedures longer than 64K
--    Changes are in 
--       With clause: added body_source and body_source2 CTEs to make chunking of source code simplier
--       stored procedure body generation section is all new
--  Please note: 
--      This code will place language and security options at end of generated code, even if original source had it at the top
--      SQL will prefix the create procedure object name with the source schema
--      Only the database that you are connected to will be processed
--      Some lines could be split differently than original source, but generated code will run the same
